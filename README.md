# Crime-Cast: Forecasting Crime Categories (Portfolio Project) (Kaggle-competition)

# Steps involved:
## Look at the big picture
Frame the problem
My first question will be what exactly the business objective is? I am asked to build a model to really understand which algorithm to choose, and which performance measure to use I need to understand How does the company expect to use and benefit from this model.
The second question would be is there any current solution? That could be my reference for performance.
By leveraging machine learning techniques, I need to analyze this rich dataset to predict crime categories, enhance law enforcement strategies, and bolster public safety measures.
